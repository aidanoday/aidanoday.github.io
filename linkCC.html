    <h2>Background</h2>

    <container class="flex-stacker">
      <p>Link was conceived in the summer of 2022, after our term-sheet investor lost their LPs, and we lost our funding.  Broke and burning personal reserves quickly, we had to refocus on getting proven results, user growth, and adjust our roadmap given our urgent resource constraints.  Prior to funding collapse, we were already surveying our userbase monthly to track product market fit and identify key areas of improvement that would allow us to find product-market fit.</p>

      <p>The biggest obstacles to adoption of our app, according to web users and artists and creators in our network:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>There aren't enough people on ILWE.</b> Roughly 35% of those surveyed responded this way.</li>
        <li><b>The ILWE app doesn't offer me something new or useful.</b> Roughly 35% of those surveyed responded this way.</li>
        <li><b>Building my portfolio is too complicated and time consuming</b> Roughly 10% of those surveyed responded this way.</li>
        <li><b>The app does not look, feel, or perform like a professional app</b> Roughly 10% of those surveyed responded this way.</li>
      </ol>

      <p> 1:1 follow-up interviews with survey respondents had indicated that we could address these issues with by redesigning the app's aesthetic, by improving our feed with filters and feedback options, and by iterating on the guardrails and supported uploads in the portfolio builder.  With our NPS score hovering around 3 and a sizeable seed round term sheet signed and turned over to our investors lawyers, things were looking good for our plan to scale our small team, create a more compelling, useful experience for our users, and round out 2022 with organic growth and possible marketing.</p>

      <p> Faced with the sudden reality of limited resources, however, we had to collect ourselves and pivot.  What can we do right now to improve on accessiblity and drive more engagement?  Through better education on how to use its complex features?  Through the addition of simple social reactions to our content feed?  Though both goood options in their own rite, we decided on more a more radical rework of the app, which lead to the removal of complex, confusing, and not yet useful features to refocus on the basics of creative connection.</p>

    <h2>Simplify, Refocus, Facelift</h2>

    <container class="flex_stacker">
      <p>The most incisive question we asked ourselves was: if we could go back to Nov 2019, knowing what we know now, what would we build?  Throughout ILOVEWHATEVER's journey, our mission has been to foster genuine connections betweeen up and coming artists.  For a long time, we thought that the best way to do this was through improving the portfolio experience, having artists upload their work, and tracking mutual collaboration.  But consistently through our interviewing, it became more and more clear that for most artists and creatives, our current portfolio experience was just not working.  A large part of this is that we did not have the resources to support direct upload of audio or video files.  So, without the capacity or near-term prospect of supporting hi-fidelity portfolio uploads, it would have been much simpler to just ask people "who are your trusted creative peers?" and focus on networking. But it took a long time and lots of iteration for key stakeholders to accept that simple declarative connection, without was a valid indicator of genuine creative connection. Relaxing that constraint gave us a lot of freedom to rethink the tangled information web we had woven.  Becuase those we interviewed responed well to our mission of fostering creative connection accross the board, and only some users were engaging with the portfolio building aspects of ILWE, we felt that simplification of the app and a refocus on networking was the best way forward.</p>

    <container class="flex_stacker">
        <p>We arrived at three core features of an app geared towards creative connection:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Representation of the artistic self.</b> Interviews with core users and observed trends in the creative community towards link lists indicated that a simple, customizable profile page with list of important links is preferable to a complex and incomplete portfolio system. </li>
          <li><b>Information about your own creative network.</b> Access to everyone in your creative network, in your pocket, without any noise.</li>
          <li><b>Ability to search for creatives by name, role, and location:</b> It is essential that our users can easily find each other once they are on the app.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The new app is simple, elegant and focused on creative connection.  It consistes of the Search Page, the Connections Hub with an integrated messenger, the Network Graph Explorer, and a Customizeable Profile:</p>

    <!--h2>Updated Design System</h2>

    <container class="flex-stacker">
      <p>In contrast to the minimalist, "move fast and break stuff" ILWE.io and the app we had been working on for 8 months, wanted to create a new, intentional, "finished" look for Link.  Keeping the basic layout agreed upon during wireframing, I defined all of the colors and shadows in the high-fidelity prototype using colors and styles stored in our Design Library.  This early investment in time and thought paid off massively because it allowed me to iterate with color, font, and style very quickly using a control panel and see those styles instantly propogate throughout the entire design. </p>

      <p>Here are the most consistently supported color themes:</p>
      <img src="assets/Themes:Light.png" alt="Four Neumorphic theme mockups in rose gold, sage green, light gray, and dark gray." class="full-width">
      <img src="assets/ThemesDark.png" alt="Four Neumorphic theme mockups in rose gold, sage green, light gray, and dark gray." class="full-width">
      <img src="assets/ThemesFuturalley.png" alt="Four Neumorphic theme mockups in rose gold, sage green, light gray, and dark gray." class="full-width">

      <p>The above three designs were the most consistently popular, with the dark theme getting the most consistent support, but also often critiqued as too masculine.  The team ultimately chose the dark theme for our first release becuase of the consistent support it recieved, with plans to test more neutral tones with users for the second release.</p>

      <p>Maybe a blue neumorphic theme is in order. The benefit of the parameter-controlled prototype is that even while writing up this case study, I can tweak the theme in a matter of minutes:</p>

    <h2>Takeaways and Next Steps</h2>

    <container class="flex-stacker">
      <p> Even despite our compressed timeline, we were able to build and release <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/link-creative-connections/id1598695254">the Link: Creative Connections MVP</a> in September.  It felt amazing to come together in the grips of existential crises and put together a beautiful, cohesive, and refocused design, and to release a great foundation for improvements.  The design provides for the following improvements, should anyone wish to pick up on our progress and continue with next steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><b>Contact-list integration-</b> Users could integrate their contacts list to find Link users they might know or recruit close friends who are not yet on the app.</li>
          <li><b>More comprehensive profile customizability-</b> Users could control button opacity, pick custom background colors. and add dimension using background filters.</li>
          <li><b>Auto-import link lists-</b> Automatic transfers from competitors like LinkTree would make the switch from LinkTree to relatively easy for users who want the expanded networking capabilites that Link offers.</li>
          <li><b>Feed-</b> A master-list of all of their connections newest profile blocks. Users could stay up to date with, respond to, and spread the latest projects that their creative connections have added to their profiles.</li>
          <li><b>Group Messaging-</b> Even better than talking to each of your creative connections, is talking together.  This would form the basis for collective action and creation.</li>
          <li><b>MultiMedia Messages-</b> Chat-based communication is multimedia by default.  In order to be successful, Link's messenger would have to support photo content if not more expanded options.</li>
          <li><b>Expanded profile block options-</b> Right now the app only suports link blocks, but I also envisioned user options expanding to include Text, Photo, and Video blocks.</li>
          <li><b>Link analytics-</b> Understanding how many people have clicked each link in your profile is important for professional artists who use the links to direct fans to their work, and would be cool for even more casual users.</li>
        </ol>

      
      <p> We were not able to achieve the viral, explosive growth that we needed to continue with focus on this project.  In the first week after release, we saw 117 new accounts, attributable to a small backyard concert we threw to support launch.  As of Nov 4th, we've seen accounts continue to trickle in absent any promotion, and a handful of user sessions every week.  Maybe it will catch on and grow.  Without resources to put behind improvement, promotion and release, spontaneous organic growth is not expected.</p>
