                <p>To stabilize one‚Äôs mood, the box had to be:</p>
                <p><b>Delightful</b> so that students will engage with the box for a duration of time and learn to actively seek the product when in a unengaged or overly-distressed state of being. We wanted to use delight to help them behavior regulation.</p>

            <!--p>
                We first learned about the zones of regulation (pictured below) from an occupational therapist. In general, those with autism move into states of alertness that impinge learning and interaction. The purpose of mood regulation is to assist in keeping people in the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù zone ‚Äî in which they are neither under stimulated nor overstimulated beyond an easy calming.  This led us to define our problem statement as a solution to help navigate the difficulty of regulating one‚Äôs state of alertness.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/tactileCube_zonesOfRegulation.jpeg">
            <p>
                From there, we identified four main use cases where the box might be used according to the four occupational therapists and teachers that we interviewed.
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>At an Occupational Therapist's Office</b> as an educational toy, with both calming and exciting textures.</li>
                    <li><b>During Transportation</b>in which case we needed to prepare for the possibilitiy that it becomes a projectile.</li>
                    <li><b>At home</b> in which case the box needs to be engaging enough to be used alone.</li>
                    <li><b>Indvidually during class</b> in which case it might need to be smaller (fidget or hand-sized) and have calming textures only, to avoid being a distraction.</li>
                </ul>

                <p> We chose to focus on the occupational therapist office setting after learning about how occupational therapists could use the box to teach self mood regulating skills through pairing.</p>

                <p> One caveat we discovered when talking to Professor John Collier, Thayer Engineering, is that special needs populations might not have predictable or cohesive user group needs in comparison to neuro-typical user groups. This particularly applies to the Autism user group. It is highly difficult to segment people situated on the Autism spectrum into different profiles, given that Autism manifests itself differently in everyone it affects. Therefore, others in the past have struggled to mass-produce products to address the needs of people with Autism. Nonetheless, we decided that providing a solution for even a select subgroup of people with Autism would make an impact. This also led us to consider the idea of customizable tiles that served as a different solution for each user.</p>
