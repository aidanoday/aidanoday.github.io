                           Machine learning and NLP have a lot of potential to help researchers and other groups gather information from open forums like twitter. But some things are confusing for machines. For example: If we want to teach machines how to differentiate between muni lines and street names, we can use humans to quickly label trainer tweets.<br><br>I’ve been working with the Code for SF brigade to create a clean, fast, efficient UI for an app that can let researchers and volunteers churn through tweets.<br><br>I love this project because the team is great, and because it has taught me a lot about marrying front and backend, and challenged me to think of ways to make something like data labeling snappy and fun!</div>

                <div class="par1">The inspiration for this project came from a course that I took: ENGS 012: Design Thinking. The assignment was to reframe a common idea, and communicate that reframe using Photoshop to design a poster.<br><br>Canada Goose jackets are controversial- most justify their purchase by saying: “Yes, it is expensive, but it’s also very warm.  It’s worth the cost.”  Canada Goose itself often puts out material claiming that their jackets are highly technical and flaunting purported quality certifications.<br><br>I want to  challenge that justification by highlighting some of the non-monetary costs of Canada Goose jackets.  A poster like this aims to change how the audience sees Canada Goose jackets.<br><br>Is a Canada Goose Jacket really neccessary in New England?  Possibly.  But this poster says that these jackets are not elegant investments in comfort; they are expensive fashion statements with additional costs to be considered.</div>
