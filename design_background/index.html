      <h1>UX Design Background</h1>
      <h2>Early Days</h2>
      <p>My design career started in early 2018.  At first I was just taking design courses, developing <a .subtle href="../legacy-fall2019/breakdown-tote.html">better ways for messy students to carry things</a> from class to class, prototyping different textures aimed at <a href="../legacy-fall2019/tactile-cube.html">helping severely autistic students regulate energy levels</a>, and helping school administrators understand how and why students were ‘cheating.’</p>
      <p>When I graduated, I volunteered at civic hack nights to <a .subtle href="../legacy-fall2019/in-progress.html">help people understand rent protection elligibility</a> and find <a>better ways to label thousands of tweets</a> while I was traveling in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>In Fall 2019 I also built this site, then tried to rip out all the html and get around wix gatekeeping to build the <a .subtle href="../legacy-fall2019/index.html">2019 version of this site,</a> which was a frankenstein's monster of a site.</p>
      <p>During quarantine, I worked with my brother, Kieran, to build a website for our pottery. <a .subtle href="https://studioday.web.app/">a website for our pottery.</a></p>
      <p>I designed it and he built it.  He's a very talented developer.</p>
      <h2>Founding Designer at ILWE, INC</h2>
      <p>In Nov 2019, I joined my friends PJ and Maddie in trying to improve networking in creative industries as the technical design co-founder, defacto CPO and Head of Product at ILOVEWHATEVER.  We spent a year and a half building <a .subtle href="www.ilovewhatever.com/aidan">a social media site for artists</a> that aimed to make portolio building easier.  Writeup coming... soon.</p>
      <p>In Aug 2020, in response to persistent user questions about an app, we spent another year developing and porting that web-platform-social-portoflio-experience into a pocket-sized, iphone-and-android-friendly app. </p>
      <p>The whole time we had been struggling with efforts to make our tool powerful, flexible, while comprehensive while keeping it simple enought that users could onboard without too much difficulty. In the end, we decided quite recently to simplify the app and center it around creative connections, renaming it from "ILWE" to "Link."</p>
      <p>And so, we’ve spent the last 2 months pivoting and stripping that concept to the minimum to create a simpler, more elegant, more useful experience, which we have already *partially, *unofficially, released.  Here’s a sneak peek:</p>
      <p>A work-in-progress version of it is live on the app store right now, to be completed and launched on September 2nd</p>
      <p>Here's a preview of the Hi-Fidelity Design Prototype on which the app is based:</p>
