      <h1>Design Background</h1>
      <p>My design career started in early 2018.  At first I was just taking design courses,  developing better ways for messy students to carry things class to class, helping autistic students focus, and helping school administrators understand how and why students were ‘cheating.’</p>
      <p>When I graduated, I volunteered at civic hack nights to help people understand rent protection elligibility and find better ways to label thousands of tweets while I was traveling in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>In Fall 2019 I also built this site, then tried to rip out all the html and get around wix gatekeeping to build this site, (which is better, but still missing SSL Auth while I troubleshoot).</p>
      <p>In Nov 2019, I joined my friends PJ and Maddie in trying to improve networking in creative industries as the technical design co-founder, defacto CPO and Head of Product at ILOVEWHATEVER.  We spent a year and a half building this site, and another year porting that web platform social-portoflio experience into an mobile app. I’ve spent the last 2 months pivoting and stripping that concept to the minimum to create a simpler, more elegant, more useful experience, which we have already *partially, *unofficially, released.  Here’s a sneak peek:</p>
      <p>A work-in-progress version of it is live on the app store right now.</p>
      <p>You can see a sample of the core pixel-perfect features here in Appendix: Constellation Hi Fidelity Overview.</p>
      <p>You can see a sample of my wireframes->HiFidelity and component organization methods here in Appendix: Constellation Sprint: Wireframes -> Hi Fidelity Component Library.</p>
